<H1><A
NAME="z1" HREF="URI_Overview.html">About this document</A></H1>This document defines the syntax
used by the World-Wide Web initiative
to encode the names and addresses
of objects on the Internet.  The
web is considered to include objects
accessed using an extendable number
of protocols, existing, invented
for the web itself, or to be invented
in the future.  Access instructions
for an individual object under a
given protocol are encoded into forms
of address string.  Other protocols
allow the use of object names of
various forms.  In order to abstract
the idea of a generic object, the
web needs the concepts of the universal
set of objects, and of the universal
set of  names or addresses of objects.<P>
A Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
is a member of this universal set
of names in registered name spaces
and addresses referring to registered
protocols or name spaces.  A Uniform
Resource Locator (URL), defined elsewhere,
is a form of URI which expresses
an address which maps onto an access
algorithm using network protocols.
Existing URI schemes which correspond
to the (still mutating) concept of
IETF URLs are listed here. The Uniform
Resource Name (URN) debate attempts
to define a name space (and presumably
resolution protocols) for persistent
object names. This area is not addressed
by this document, which is written
in order to document existing practice
and provide a reference point for
URL and URN discussions.<P>
This document  is therefore to be
issued under the  <A
NAME="z2" HREF="1_InfoDisclaimer.html">"informational
RFC" disclaimer</A> .<P>
The world-wide web protocols are
discussed on the mailing list www-talk-request@info.cern.ch
and the newsgroup comp.infosystems.www
is preferable for beginner's questions.
The mailing list uri-request@bunyip.com
has discussion related particularly
to the URI issue.  The author may
be contacted as timbl@info.cern.ch.<P>

<H1><A
NAME="z3" HREF="URI_Overview.html">The need for a universal syntax</A> </H1>This section describes the concept
of the URI and does not form part
of the specification.<P>
Many protocols and <A
NAME="z1" HREF="Note_systems.html">systems</A> for document
search and retrieval are currently
in use, and many more protocols or
refinements of existing protocols
are to be expected in a field whose
expansion is explosive.  <P>
These systems are aiming to achieve
global search and readership of documents
across differing computing platforms,
and despite a plethora of protocols
and data formats.   As protocols
evolve, gateways can allow global
access to remain possible. As data
formats evolve, format conversion
programs can preserve global access.
There is one area, however, in which
it is impractical to make conversions,
and that is in the names and addresses
used to identify objects.  This is
because names and addresses of objects
are passed on in so many ways, from
the backs of envelopes to hypertext
objects, and may have a long life.<P>
A common feature of almost all the
data models of past and proposed
systems is something which can be
mapped onto a concept of "object"
and some kind of name, address, or
identifier for that object.  One
can therefore define a set of name
spaces in which these objects can
be said to exist.<P>
Practical systems need to access
and mix objects which are part of
different existing and proposed systems.
Therefore, the concept of the universal
set of all objects, and hence the
universal set of names and addresses,
in all name spaces, becomes important.
This allows names in different spaces
to be treated in a common way, even
though names in different spaces
have differing characteristics, as
do the objects to which they refer.
<H2>URIs</H2>This document defines a way to encapsulate
a name in any registered name space,
and label it with the the name space,
producing a member of the universal
set.  Such an encoded and labelled
member of this set is known as a
Universal Resource Identifier, or
URI.<P>
The universal syntax allows access
of objects available using existing
protocols, and may be extended with
technology. <P>
The specification of the URI syntax
does not imply anything about the
properties of names and addresses
in the various name spaces which
are mapped onto the set of URI strings.
 The properties follow from the specifications
of the protocols and the associated
usage conventions for each scheme.
<H2>URLs</H2>For existing Internet access protocols,
it is necessary in most cases to
define the encoding of the access
algorithm into something concise
enough to be termed address.  URIs
which refer to objects accessed with
existing protocols are known as "Uniform
Resource Locators" (URLs) and are
listed here as used in WWW, but to
be formally defined  in a <A
NAME="z2" HREF="Overview.html">separate
document</A> .
<H2>URNs</H2>There is currently a drive to define
a space of more persistent names
than any URLs.  These "Uniform Resource
Names" are the subject of an IETF
working group's discussions.  (See
Sollins and Masinter, Functional
Specifications for URNs, circulated
informally.)<P>
The URI syntax and URL forms have
been in widespread use by World-Wide
Web software since 1990.</BODY>

<H1><A
NAME="z2" HREF="URI_Overview.html">Design criteria and choices</A></H1>This section is not part of the specification:
it is simply an explanation of the
way in which the specification was
derived.
<H2>Design criteria</H2>The syntax was designed to be

be added later.
<DT>Complete

any naming scheme.
<DT>Printable

so that  URIs may if necessary be

</DL>

<H2>Choices for a universal syntax </H2>For the syntax itself there is little
choice except for the order and punctuation
of the elements, and the acceptable
characters and escaping rules.<P>
The extensibility requirement is
met by allowing an arbitrary (but
registered) string to be used as
a prefix.  A prefix is chosen as
left to right parsing is more common
than right to left.   The choice
of a colon as separator of the prefix
from the rest of the URI was arbitrary.<P>
The decoding of the rest of the string
is defined as a function of the prefix.
New prefixed are introduced for new
schemes as necessary, in agreement
with the registration authority.
The registration of a new scheme
clearly requires the definition of
the decoding of the URI into a given
name space, and a definition of the
properties and, where applicable,
resolution protocols, for the name
space.<P>
The completeness requirement is easily
met by allowing particularly strange
or plain binary names to be encoded
in base 16 or 64 using the acceptable
characters.  <P>
The printability requirement could
have been met by requiring all schemes
to encode characters not part of
a basic set.   This led to many <A
NAME="z1" HREF="_Note1.html">discussions</A>
of what the basic set should be.
A difficult case, for example, is
when an ISO latin 1 string appears
in a URL, and within an application
with ISO Latin-1 capability, it can
be handled intact.  However, for
transport in general, the non-ASCII
characters need to be escaped.<P>
The solution to this was to specify
a safe set of characters, and a general
escaping scheme which may be used
for encoding "unsafe" characters.
This "safe" set is suitable, for
example, for use in electronic mail.
 This is the canonical form of a
URI. <P>
The choice of escape character for
introducing representations of non-allowed
characters also tends to be a matter
of taste. An ANSI standard exists
in the C language, using the back-slash
character "\". The use of this character
on unix command lines, however, can
be a problem as it is interpreted
by many shell programs, and would
have itself to be escaped.   It is
also a character which is not available
on certain keyboards.  The equals
sign is commonly used in the encoding
of names having attribute=value pairs.
The percent sign was eventually chosen
as a suitable escape character.<P>
There is a conflict between the need
to be able to represent many characters
including spaces within a URI directly,
and the need to be able to use a
URI in environments which have limited
character sets or in which certain
characters are prone to corruption.
This conflict has been resolved by
use of an hexadecimal escaping method
which may be applied to any characters
forbidden in a given context. When
URLs are moved between contexts,
the set of characters escaped may
be enlarged or reduced unambiguously.<P>
The use of white space characters
is risky  in URIs to be printed or
sent by electronic mail, and the
use of multiple white space characters
is very risky.  This is because of
the frequent introduction of extraneous
white space when lines are wrapped
by systems such as mail, or sheer
necessity of narrow column width,
and because of the  inter-conversion
of various forms of white space which
occurs during character code conversion
and the transfer of text between
applications.  This is why the canonical
form for URIs has all white spaces
encoded. </A></BODY>

<H1><A
NAME="z0" HREF="URI_Overview.html">Recommendations</A></H1>This section describes the syntax
for URIs as used in the WorldWide
Web initiative.  The generic syntax
provides a framework for new schemes
for names to be resolved using as
yet undefined protocols.  
<H2>URI syntax  </H2>A complete URI consists of a naming
scheme specifier followed by a string
whose format is a function of the
naming scheme. For locators of information
on the Internet, a common syntax
is used for the  IP address part.
A <A
NAME="z4" HREF="5_URI_BNF.html">BNF description</A> of the URL syntax
is given in an a later section. The
components are as follows.  <A
NAME="z2" HREF="4_2_Fragments.html">Fragment
identifiers</A> and <A
NAME="z3" HREF="4_3_Partial.html">relative URIs</A> are
not involved in the basic URL definition.
<H3>Scheme  </H3>Within the URI of a object, the first
element is the name of the scheme,
separated from the rest of the object
by a colon. 
<H3>Path</H3>The rest of the URI follows the colon
in a format depending on the scheme.
The path is interpreted in a manner
dependent on the protocol being used.
However, when it contains slashes,
these must imply a hierarchical structure.
<H2>Reserved characters</H2>The path in the URI has a significance
defined by the particular scheme.
Typically it is used to encode a
name in a given name space, or an
algorithm for accessing an object.
In either case, the encoding may
use those characters allowed by the
BNF syntax, or hexadecimal encoding
of other characters.<P>
Some of the reserved characters have
special uses as defined here.
<H3>The percent sign</H3>The percent sign ("%", ASCII 25 hex)
is used as the escape character in
the encoding scheme and is never
allowed for anything else.
<H3>Hierarchical forms</H3>The slash ("/", ASCII 2F hex) character
is reserved for the delimiting of
substrings whose relationship is
hierarchical.  This enables partial
forms of the URI.   Substrings consisting
of single or double dots ("." or
"..") are similarly reserved. <P>
The significance of the slash between
two segments is that the segment
of the path to the left is more significant
than the segment of the path to the
right.  ("Significance" in this case
refers solely to closeness to the
root of the hierarchical structure
and makes no value judgement!)
<H4>Note</H4>The similarity to unix and other
disk operating system filename conventions
should be taken as purely coincidental,
and should not be taken to indicate
that URIs should be interpreted as
file names.
<H3>Hash for Fragment Identifiers</H3>The hash ("#", ASCII 23 hex) character
is reserved as a delimiter to separate
the URI of an object from a <A
NAME="z5" HREF="4_2_Fragments.html">fragment
identifier</A> .
<H3>Query strings</H3>The question mark ("?", ASCII 3F
hex)  is used to delimit the boundary
between the URI of a queryable object,
and a set of words used to express
a query on that object.  When this
form is used, the combined URI stands
for the object which results from
the query being applied to the original
object.<P>
Within the query string, the plus
sign is reserved as shorthand notation
for a space.  Therefore, real plus
signs must be encoded.   This method
was used to make query URIs easier
to pass in systems which did not
allow spaces.<P>
The query string represents some
operation applied to the object,
but this specification gives no common
syntax or semantics for it.  In practice
the syntax and sematics may depend
on the scheme and may even on the
base URI.
<H3>Other reserved characters</H3>The astersik ("*", ASCII 2A hex)
 and exclamation mark ("!" , ASCII
21 hex) are reserved for use as having
special signifiance within specific
schemes.
<H2>Unsafe characters</H2>In canonical form, certain characters
such as spaces, control characters,
some characters whose ASCII code
is used differently in different
national character variant 7 bit
sets, and all 8bit characters beyond
DEL (7F hex) of the ISO Latin-1 set,
shall not be used unencoded. This
is a recommendation for trouble-free
interchange, and as indicated below,
the encoded set may be extended or
reduced.
<H2><A
NAME="z1">Encoding reserved characters</A></H2>When a system uses a local addressing
scheme, it is useful to provide a
mapping from local addresses into
URIs so that references to objects
within the addressing scheme may
be referred to globally, and possibly
accessed through gateway servers.<P>
For a new naming scheme, any mapping
scheme may be defined provided it
is unambiguous, reversible, and provides
valid URIs. It is recommended that
where hierarchical aspects to the
local naming scheme exist, they be
mapped onto the hierarchical URL
path syntax in order to allow the
partial form to be used. <P>
  It is also recommended that the
conventional scheme below be used
in all cases except for any scheme
which encodes binary data as opposed
to text, in which case a more compact
encoding such as pure hexadecimal
or base 64 might be more appropriate.
For example, the conventional URI
encoding method is used for mapping
WAIS, FTP, Prospero and Gopher addresses
in the URI specification.
<H3>Conventional URI encoding scheme</H3>Where the local naming scheme uses
ASCII characters which are not allowed
in the URI,  these may be represented
in the URL by a percent sign "%"
immediately followed by two hexadecimal
digits (0-9, A-F) giving the ISO
Latin 1 code for that character.
Character codes other than those
allowed by the syntax shall not be
used unencoded in a URI. 
<H3>Reduced or increased safe character
sets</H3>The same encoding method may be used
for encoding characters whose use,
although technically allowed in a
URI, would be unwise due to problems
of corruption by imperfect gateways
or misrepresentation due to the use
of variant character sets, or which
would simply be awkward in a given
environment.  Because a % sign always
indicates an encoded character, a
URI may be made "safer" simply by
encoding any characters considered
unsafe, while leaving already encoded
characters still encoded.  Similarly,
in cases where a larger set of characters
is acceptable, % signs can be selectively
and reversibly expanded.<P>
Before two URIs can be compared,
it is therefore necessary to bring
them to the same encoding level.<P>
However, the reserved characters
mentioned above have a quite different
significance when encoded, and so
may NEVER be encoded and unencoded
in this way.  <P>
The percent sign intended as such
must always be encoded, as its presence
otherwise always indicates an encoding.
Sequences which start with a percent
sign but are not followed by two
hexadecimal characters are reserved
for future extension. (see <A
NAME="z7" HREF="#z6">example
3</A> )

<BODY>
<H2><A
NAME="z2" HREF="URI_Overview.html">Partial (relative) form</A>  </H2>Within a object whose URI is well
defined, the URI of another object
may be given in abbreviated form,
where parts of the two URIs are the
same. This allows objects within
a group to refer to each other without
requiring the space for a complete
reference, and it incidentally allows
the group of objects  to be moved
without changing any references.
 It must be emphasized that when
a reference is passed in anything
other than a well controlled context,
the full form must always be used.
<P>
In the World-Wide Web applications,
the context URI is that of the document
or object containing a reference.
In this case partial URIs can be
generated in virtual objects or stored
in real objects, without the need
for dramatic change if the higher-order
parts of a hierarchical naming system
are modified.   Apart from terseness,
this gives greater robustness to
practical systems,  by enabling information
hiding between system components.<P>
The partial form relies on a property
of the URI syntax that certain characters
("/") and certain path elements ("..",
".") have a significance reserved
for representing a hierarchical space,
and must be recognized as such by
both clients and servers. <P>
A partial form can be distinguished
from an absolute form in that the
latter must have a colon and that
colon must occur before any slash
characters. Systems not requiring
partial forms should not use any
unencoded slashes in their naming
schemes.  If they do, absolute URIs
will still work, but confusion may
result. (See <A
NAME="z4" HREF="#z3">note on Gopher</A> below).<P>
The rules for the use of a partial
name relative to the URI of  the
context are:  
<UL>
<LI>If the scheme parts  are different,
the whole absolute URI must be given.
Otherwise, the scheme is omitted,
and:
<LI>If the partial URI starts with a
non-zero number of consecutive slashes,
then everything from the context
URI up to (but not including) the
first occurrence of exactly the same
number of consecutive slashes which
has no greater number of consecutive
slashes anywhere to the right of
it is taken to be the same and so
prepended to the partial URL to form
the full URL. Otherwise:
<LI>The last part of the path of the
context URI (anything following the
rightmost slash) is removed, and
the given partial URI appended in
its place, and then:
<LI>Within the result,  all occurrences
of "xxx/../"  or "/." are recursively
removed, where xxx, ".." and "."
are complete path elements.
</UL>
<H5>Note: Trailing slashes</H5>If a path of the context locator
ends in slash, partial URIs are treated
differently to the URI with the same
path but without a trailing slash.
The trailing slash indicates a void
segment of the path.
<H5><A
NAME="z3">Note: Gopher</A></H5>The gopher system does not have the
concept of relative URIs, and the
gopher community currently allows
/ as data characters in gopher URIs
without escaping them to %2F.  Relative
forms may not in general be used
for documents served by gopher servers.
If they are used, then WWW software
assumes, normally correctly, that
in fact they do have hierarchical
significance despite the specifications.
The use of HTTP rather than gopher
protocol is however recommended.
<H4>Examples</H4>In the context of URI
<PRE>			magic://a/b/c//d/e/f

</PRE>the partial URIs would expand as
follows:
<DL>
<DT>g
<DD> magic://a/b/c//d/e/g

<DT>//g
<DD> magic://g

<DT>g:h
<DD> g:h
</DL>
and in the context of the URI
<PRE>			magic://a/b/c//d/e/

</PRE>the results would be exactly the
same. 	</BODY>

<H2>FTP  </H2>The ftp: prefix indicates that the
FTP protocol <A
NAME="z30" HREF="Note_FTP_Alt.html">is</A> used, as defined
in <A
NAME="z11" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/Overview.html">RFC957</A> or any successor. The port
number, if present, gives the port
of the FTP server if not the FTP
default. 
<H4>User name and password</H4>The syntax allows for the inclusion
of a user name and even a password
for those systems which do not use
the anonymous FTP convention. The
default, however, if no user or password
is supplied, will be to use that
convention, viz. that the user name
is "anonymous" and the password <A
NAME="z22" HREF="Note_AFTP.html">the
user's Internet-style mail address</A>
.<P>
Where possible, this mail address
should correspond to a usable mail
address for the user, and preferably
give a DNS host name which resolves
to the IP address of the client.
Note that servers currently vary
in their treatment of the anonymous
password. 
<H4>Path</H4>The FTP protocol allows for a sequence
of <A
NAME="z10" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/Overview.html#z0">CWD</A> commands (change working directory)
and a <A
NAME="z29" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z2">TYPE command</A> prior to  <A
NAME="z31" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z3">service
commands</A> such as <A
NAME="z32" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z1">RETR</A> (retrieve)
or <A
NAME="z33" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z5">NLIST</A>  (etc) which actually access
a file. <P>
The arguments of any CWD commands<A
NAME="z34" HREF="Note_FTP_CWD_Alt.html">
are</A> successive<A
NAME="z9" HREF="5_BNF.html#z59"> segment</A> parts of the
URL delimited by slash, and the final
segment is suitable as the filename
argument to the <A
NAME="z12" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z1">RETR </A>command for
retrieval or the directory argument
to NLIST.<P>
For some file systems (Unix in particular),
the "/" used to denote the hierarchical
structure of the URL corresponds
to the delimiter used to construct
a file name hierarchy, and thus,
the filename will look the same as
the URL path. This does NOT mean
that the URL is a Unix filename.
<H5>Note: Retrieving subsequent URLs
from the same host</H5>There is no common hierarchical model
to the FTP protocol, so if a directory
change command has been given, it
is impossible in general to deduce
what sequence should be given to
navigate to another directory for
a second retrieval, if the paths
are different.  The only reliable
algorithm is to disconnect and reestablish
the control connection.  
<H4><A
NAME="z28">Data type</A></H4>The data content type of a file can
only, in the general FTP case, be
deduced from the name, normally the
suffix of the name. This is not standardized.
An alternative is for it to be transferred
in information outside the URL. A
suitable FTP transfer type (for example
binary "I"  or text "A") must in
turn be deduced from the data content
type.  It is recommended that conventions
for suffixes of public archives be
established, but it is outside the
scope of this standard.<P>
An FTP URL may optionally specify
the FTP data transfer type by which
an object is to be retrieved. Most
of the methods correspond to the<A
NAME="z23" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/3_DataTransfer.html#z2">
FTP "Data Types"</A> ASCII and IMAGE
for the retrieval of a document,
as specified in FTP by the <A
NAME="z27" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/4_FileTransfer.html#z2">TYPE command</A>
. One method indicates directory
access.<P>
The data type is specified by a suffix
to the URL. Possible suffixes are:
<DL>
<DT>;type = <A
NAME="z35" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc959/5_Declarative.html#z9">&lt;type-code></A>
<DD> Use <A

<DT>/
<DD> Use FTP directory list commands

The type code is in the format <A

<H4>Transfer Mode</H4><A

<H2>Gopher</H2>The gopher URL specifies the host
and optionally the port to which
the  client should connect. This
is followed by a slash and a single
gopher type  code. This type code
is used by the client to determine
how to interpret the  server's reply
and is is not for sending to server.
 The command  string to be sent to
the server immediately follows the
gopher type character. It consists
of the gopher selector string followed
by  any "Gopher plus" syntax, but
always omitting the trainling CR
LF pair.<P>
 When the gopher command string contains
characters (such a embedded CR LF
and HT characters) not allowed in
a URL, these are encoded using the
conventional encoding.<P>
 <P>
Note that some gopher selector strings
begin with a copy of the gopher type
character, in which case that character
will occur twice consecutively. Also
note that the gopher selector string
may be an empty string since this
is how  gopher clients refer to the
top-level directory on a gopher server.<P>
If the encoded command string (with
trailing CR LF stripped) would be
void then the gopher type character
may be omiited and "1" (ASCII 31
hex) is assumed.<P>

Note that slash "/" in gopher selector
strings may not correspond  to a

<H4>Note1: </H4>Among URLs the "news" URLs are anomalous
in that they are location-independent.
They are unsuitable as URN candidates
because the NNTP architecture relies
on the expiry of articles and therefore
a small number of articles being
available at any time.  When a news:
URL is quoted, the assumption is
that the reader will fetch the article
or group from his or her local news
host.  News host names are NOT part
of news URLs.
<H4>Note 2:</H4>An outstanding problem is that the
message identifier is insufficient
to allow the retrieval of an expired
article, as no algorithm exists for
deriving an archive site and file
name. The addition of the date and
news group set to the article's URL
would allow this if a directory existed
of archive sites by news group. Suggested
subject of study in conjunction with

NAME="z5" HREF="5_BNF.html#z51">WAIS</A>  </H2>The current WAIS implementation public

the "type" of a object prior to retrieval.
This value is returned along with

<H2>file</H2>The other URI schemes (except nntp)
share the property that they are
equally valid at any geographical
place.<P>
There is however a real practical
requirement to be able to generate
a URL for an object in a machine's
local file system.<P>
The syntax is similar to the ftp
syntax, but in this case the slash
is used to donate boundaries between
directory levels of a hierarchical
file system is used.   The "client"
software converts the file URL into
a file name in the local file name
conventions.  This allows local files
to be treated just as network objects
without any necessity to use a network
server for access.  This may be used
for example for defining a user's
"home" document in WWW.<P>
There is clearly a danger of confusion
that a link made to a local file
should be followed by someone on
a different system, with unexpected
and possibly harmful results.  Therefore,
the convention is that even a "file"
URL is provided with a host part.
 This allows a client on another
system to know that it cannot access
the file system, or perhaps to use
some other local mecahnism to access
the file.<P>
The special value "localhost" is
used in the host field to indicate
that the filename should really be
used on whatever host one is.  This
for example allows links to be made
to files which are distribted on
many machines, or to "your unix local
password file" subject of course
to consistency across the users of
the data.<P>
A void host field is equivalent to
"localhost".

by the nature of mail, those items
are only available to a restricted

Two schemes are defined.  The first,

the "mid:"  is the RFC822 <A

with the constant &lt;> wrapper removed,
leaving an identifier whose format
in fact happens to be the same as
<A
NAME="z18" HREF="../../Protocols/rfc822/Overview.html#z7">addr-spec</A> format for mailboxes (though
the semantics are different).<P>
The use of a "mid" URL implies access

<H2>Content-Id</H2>The second scheme, "cid:", is similar
to <A

a body part of a MIME message by
the value of its content-id field.
This allows, for example, a master

a multipart/related MIME message
to refer to component parts which
are transferred in the same message.
<H4>Note</H4>Beware however, that content identifiers
are only required to be unique within
the context of a given MIME message,

<H2>Registration of naming schemes  </H2>A new naming scheme may be introduced
by defining a mapping onto a conforming
URL syntax, using a new prefix. Experimental
prefixes may be used by mutual agreement
between parties, and must start with
the characters "x-".  The scheme
name "urn:" is reserved for the work
in progress on a scheme for more
persistent names.  <P>
It is proposed that the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
perform the function of registration
of new schemes. Any submission of
a new URI scheme must include a definition
of an algorithm for the retrieval
of any object within that scheme.
The algorithm must take  the URI
and produce either a set of URL(s)
which will lead to the desired object,
or the object itself, in a well-defined
or determinable format.<P>
It is recommended that those proposing
a new scheme demonstrate its utility
and operability by the provision
of a gateway which will provide images
of objects in the new scheme for
clients using an existing protocol.
If the new scheme is not a locator
scheme, then the properties of names
in the new space should be clearly
defined.  It is likewise recommended
that, where a protocol allows for
retrieval by URL, that the client
software have provision for being
configured to use specific gateway
locators for indirect access through
new naming schemes.</A><P>
